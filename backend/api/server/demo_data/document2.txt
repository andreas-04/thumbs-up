SECURE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
======================

This document outlines the deployment procedure for ThumbsUp NAS
on Raspberry Pi or similar embedded hardware.

Hardware Requirements:
---------------------
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB+ RAM recommended)
- USB 3.0 storage device (encrypted with LUKS)
- Reliable power supply
- Wireless network adapter (built-in or USB)
- Optional: Physical activation button

Software Requirements:
---------------------
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite (or similar)
- Python 3.10+
- Avahi daemon (mDNS)
- NFS kernel server
- OpenSSL
- cryptsetup (for LUKS)

Deployment Steps:
----------------
1. Format USB storage with LUKS encryption
2. Generate CA and issue certificates
3. Configure firewall default policy
4. Install application and dependencies
5. Set up systemd service
6. Configure activation trigger (GPIO button)
7. Test with authenticated client
8. Monitor logs and verify security

Security Checklist:
------------------
□ CA private key stored securely (HSM recommended)
□ Client certificates issued with expiration
□ CRL endpoint configured and accessible
□ Firewall default-deny policy active
□ Storage encryption key protected
□ System logs secured and rotated
□ Regular security updates scheduled

For production deployment, ensure all pseudocode sections
are replaced with actual implementations.
